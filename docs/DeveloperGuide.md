## Setting up

## Design 
### Architecture

<img src="uml/images/DinerDirectorArchitectureDiagram.png" height="300" height="200">

The **Architecture Diagram** given above explains the high-level design of DinerDirector. 
Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other. 

**Architecture of Main Components** <br/>
`DinerDirector` entry point to the application is DinerDirector. Initially, `DinerDirector` class interact with `UI` class to 
prompt user for inputs. Once user keys in the input text, the input will be redirected to `Parser` class. `Parser` class will manage the error 
handling of user's input. Next, any logic will be executed by `Command` object. If there exists any interaction with `Entity`, `Command` will 
request to `Manager` to assist the CRUD operations.  

### Command Component

##### The command component consists of the following:

![](uml/images/CommandPackageDiagram.png)

- 4 subcomponents: Command, HelpCommand, ExitCommand, IncorrectCommand

- 4 sub packages with the following names: deadline, meeting, menu and staff
    - Each package contains the 3 general commands:
        - AddCommand
        - DeleteCommand
        - ViewCommand
    - The general commands have specific names depending on the package it is in.

The command component consist of the Abstract `Command` class.
It has multiple child `Command` classes that inherits from the Abstract `Command` Class.
Each child `Command` class accepts arguments that are parsed from the `Parser` class and set those arguments to private variables in their respective classes, if there is any private variables to be set.
An `execute` method will execute the operations needed for each individual commands.
An `isExit` method will return a boolean value that decides whether the program should exit after this command is called.


### Manager Component
The manager component consists of four different managers, 
in which the list of entity is initialized and the methods implementing the entity are written inside.
- DeadlineManager: This class contains an ArrayList of deadlines and methods implementing the deadlines like addDeadline, printDeadline and deleteDeadline.
- DishManager: This class contains an ArrayList of dishes and methods like addDish, deleteDish, viewDish and 
stringOfDish which returns the dish information.
- MeetingManager: This class contains an ArrayList of meetings and methods like addMeeting, printMeetings and deleteMeeting.
- StaffManager: This class contains an ArrayList of staffs and methods like addStaff, deleteStaffByName, findStaffByName and getStaffString which print all the staffs' information.

### Ui Component

![](uml/images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The Ui Component consists of the `TextUi` class that handles interactions between the app and the user.

The `TextUi`class performs the following functions:
* Reading the user input through `DinerDirector` class (Empty inputs will be ignored)

    method: `getUserInput()`
* Printing messages generated by the app to the terminal through 'XYZManager', where XYZ stands for each of the entity in our app.

    methods: `printBanner()`, `printMessage()`

### Utils Component

![](uml/images/UtilsParserClassDiagram.png)    
The Utils Component consists of the `Parser` class that will handle the parsing and preparing of commands within the DinerDirector application.  

The `Parser` class performs the following functions:  
* Parse the command given the user input and extracts out the necessary information related to the command.
* Returns the appropriate Command Class based on the parsed input.

![](uml/images/UtilsStorageClassDiagram.png)  
The Utils Component also consists of the `Storage` class and the individual `XYZStorage` that will handle storage related operations within the DinerDirector application.  

The `Storage` class performs the following functions:
* Create a directory in the root folder of where the application is running.

The `XYZStorage` class performs the following functions:
* Read and load data from the file.
* Write to the file if any changes occur to the list.

## Implementation
### Parsing Feature

![](./uml/images/ParserSequenceDiagram.png)  
How the parsing works:
1. The `Parser()` class will be called to create a new instance of `Parser`.
2. Afterwards, when the `parseCommand()` method is called from `DinerDirector` class, the `parseCommand()` will split the given userInput first.
2. With the `userInputSplit[]`, the `0` index will be extracted out. That will be used as identification for the command the user typed in.
3. The `commandWord` will be used in the switch statement to select the appropriate command. returning `IncorrectCommand` class is the default behavior.
4. If the `commandWord` is valid, it will run the appropriate `prepareXYZCommand()`.
5. Each of the individual `prepareXYZCommand()` will take in the userInput without the command portion. The variable is named `userInputNoCommand`. The `prepareXYZCommand()` will check the userInput to see if all the appropriate values are added, and return `XYZCommand` class if the values are correct. `prepareXXXCommand()` will return `IncorrectCommand` class if there are some missing values or inappropriate values.

### Meeting Feature
The 'Meeting' Feature allows users to add a meeting, delete a meeting, find a meeting and print all the meetings.
The 'Meeting' class in the entity package shows the attributes that a meeting object has: time and issue, both are of String type.
An ArrayList of meetings is initialized in the MeetingManager. Three methods that implement the meetings are also inside.
- addMeeting: Add a meeting to the meeting list.
  ![](uml/images/AddMeetingCommandSequenceDiagram-Add_Meeting_Sequence_Diagram.png)
- deleteMeeting: Delete a meeting in the meeting list by its index.
- printMeetings: Print all the meetings in the meeting list.

When the user input a meeting command, the Parser will determine which command it is and return a command object.
One of the meeting commands will be called from `AddMeetingCommand`, `DeleteMeetingCommand` and `ViewMeetingCommand`.
Inside the command, the execute function will call the corresponding methods inside the MeetingManager and implement on the meeting list.

### Deadline Feature
The Deadline Feature allows user to add Deadline objects in a deadline list.
Deadline objects consists of a description String and a dueDate String.
The User will also be able to delete deadlines, view deadline list.

![](uml/images/XYZDeadlineDiagram.png)

When the user input a deadline command, it will be parsed into Parser to determine which deadline command will be called.
Then, the deadline command will be executed, and the respective method in the DeadlineManager class will be called, which are:
(XYZ stands for the respective command name.)

#### Add deadline to deadline list

   Adds the `Deadline` object to the ArrayList `deadlinelist`.

   The variable here is the `Deadline` object to be added.

   A `Deadline` object can only be added to the `deadlinelist`if it has a valid `description` and `dueDate` String.

   If the addition was a success, a message will be printed through `TextUi` class to notify the reader that the `Deadline` object has been added.


#### Delete a deadline from the deadline list

   Removes a `Deadline` object from the ArrayList `deadlinelist` using the index given.

   The variable here refers to the index of the `Deadline` object that will be deleted.

   A `Deadline` object can only be removed if the index is a valid index in the list.

   If the deletion was a success, a message will be printed through `TextUi` class to notify the reader that the `Deadline` object has been deleted.

#### Printing the deadline list
   
    
Prints an ArrayList through `TextUi` class.

For `viewDeadline`, the entire deadline list `deadlinelist` will be printed.
    
For `findDeadline`, a separate list, `matchingDeadlines`, containing only deadlines with matching keywords will be created and printed.

The variable here refers to the keyword String for `findDeadline`, whereas `viewDeadline` do not require a variable.

The message here refers to the list that will be printed.

If any of the list is empty, a separate message notifying the user that the list is empty will be printed.


### Staff Feature 
The `Staff` Feature allows user to create, read, update, delete (CRUD) `Staff` objects in the list of staffs. 
`Staff` list is managed by `StaffManager` Class similar to other entity objects. Here are hot it works for each functionality: 

1. add_staff  

    It first checks whether the parameter needed to add `Staff` is already given in the correct format. If it passes the format checking, 
    the `Parser` object will return `AddStaffCommand` to be executed by `DinerDirector`. Internally, `AddStaffCommand` redirect the requests to 
    `StaffManager` to add the `Staff` object to the list of `Staff` 
2. delete_staff 

    It first finds the corresponding `Staff` object to be deleted using its name in the list in `StaffManager`. 
    If it is found, it will delete the correct corresponding `Staff`. 

3. view_staff

    It prints all of `Staff` objects in `StaffManager`'s staffs. 

### Dish Feature

The Dish feature consists of three functions:

##### Adding dish to list:

![](uml/images/AddDishCommandSequenceDiagram-Add_Dish_Sequence_Diagram.png)

- When the ```AddDishCommand()``` constructor is called, it stores the dish name, price and the list of ingredients in an entity called Dish.
- When the ```execute()``` command in ```AddDishCommand``` is called, it calls the ```addDishCommand()``` in ```DishManager``` class that adds the Dish into an arraylist of Dishes.
- It then prints out a message to the console that informs the user that a dish has been added.

##### Deleting dish on the list:
- When the ```DeleteDishCommand()``` constructor is called, it stores the index of the Dish to be deleted from the arraylist of Dishes.
- When the ```execute()``` command in ```DeleteDishCommand``` is called, it calls the ```DeleteDishCommand()``` in ```DishManager``` class that deletes the Dish at the specified index in the arraylist of Dishes
- It then prints out a message to the console that informs the user that a dish has been added.

##### Viewing the list of dishes:
- When the ```execute()``` command in ```ViewDishCommand``` is called, it calls the ```ViewDishCommand()``` in ```DishManager``` class that returns the formatted string of all the dishes in the arraylist.
- It then prints out the formatted string to the console.

### Storage Feature 
#### Create directory, Read and load from XYZ file
![](uml/images/CreateDirectorySequenceDiagram.png)  
1. The `Storage()` class will be called to create a new instance of `Storage`.
2. The `createDirectory()` method in the `Storage()` class will be called next. A directory called `data` will be created in the same folder as the application if the folder does not exist.

#### Read and load from XYZFile
![](uml/images/ReadAndLoadFromXYZFileSequenceDiagram.png)
1. The `XYZStorage()` class will be called to create a new instance of `XYZStorage`.
2. The `readAndLoadFromXYZFile()` method in the `XYZStorage()` class is called to read and load data if any application related text files exists.

#### Write to XYZ file
![](uml/images/WriteToXYZFileSequenceDiagram.png)
1. The `XYZStorage()` class will be called to create a new instance of `XYZStorage`.
2. The `writeToXYZFile()` method in the `XYZStorage()` class is called to write the contents in the list into the respective file.
3. The `writeToXYZFile()` method is called in `addXYZ()` method in the `XYZManager` class.
4. The `addXYZ()` method is called from outside `XYZManager()` class.
5. The above process is listed only for `addXYZ()`, but `deleteXYZ()` follows the same process as the above sequence diagram.
